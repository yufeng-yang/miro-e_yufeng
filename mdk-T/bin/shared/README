Example clients in this directory use the ROS interface directly.

Directory "robot"
	Example clients that use the Python RobotInterface class to hide the ROS interface.

NB: The MDK has now been upgraded to sit on top of a more modern stack, based
on ROS Noetic (rather than ROS Kinetic). Thus, all the scripts in this directory
are configured to run under Python 3, by default. Python 3 is incompatible with
ROS Kinetic, which is still used on board MIRO, so you will have to explicitly
run them under python2 if they are to work, for example:

python client_read_battery.py
