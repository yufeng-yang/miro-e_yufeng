User-facing changes since R190211:

- Updated on-board web interface to support latest MIROcode
	implementation.

- Updated LICENSE information.

- Fixed bug in example_kc.py.

- Exposed some additional core states on ROS interface.

- Various improvements to robustness of start-up procedure
	against network problems.

create_release: R190407_RC2



User-facing changes since R190407:

- MIROapp can now set wifi credentials including spaces and
	UNICODE characters.

- Added "behavioural probability" adjustment to demo (see docs).

- Increased parameter "valence_jerk_gain" to increase impact on
	affect of shaking, hitting.

- Some improvements to MIROapp GUI, particularly controller page.

- Added extra flags to demo (disable various expression routes).



################################################################
create_release: R190518_RC1



User-facing changes since R190508:

- Expanded/rationalised test/example client suite. Explore these
	at ~/mdk/bin/shared (most provide brief help when called
	with no arguments).

- Added client templates for Python and C/C++ (see docs).

- Some improvements to simulator including much improved matching
	of simulated cameras to physical cameras; significant enhancement
	of physical camera model, also.

- Some improvements to autonomous controller ("demo mode"),
	including several sensing and motion control bug fixes. With
	this release, we disable face processing on-board to reduce
	load; users can re-enable it if they prefer but it may harm
	overall demo performance.

- Added web interface to demo flags etc.; find it at
	<ip address>:8001/config.

- Added substantial update_platform layer in support of future
	software releases; several updates to platform are included
	(disable swap, apache, unattended upgrades - note that
	system upgrades are now performed explicitly during software
	updates or on a periodic basis).

- Many updates to web interface serving MIROcode.

- Improvements to reporting, interfacing; more reporting options
	in MIROapp to send information to support team in case of
	problems.

- Various bug fixes.
